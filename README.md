## step8 - wait, I upload a container with a secret!

### 0. Setup Github workflow
Open URL and set up a workflow and actions yourself
```
https://github.com/arainho/git-insecure-workshop/actions/new 
```

### 1. Setup Github secrets   
Open URL and define the variables DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
```
https://github.com/arainho/git-insecure-workshop/settings/secrets/actions
```

### 2. Run the workflow
The workflow definition with docker build and push steps is on [docker-image.yml](https://github.com/arainho/secure-git-workshop/blob/step8/.github/workflows/docker-image.yml).
After the workflow finishes, a docker image will be uploaded to your docker hub.
```
https://hub.docker.com/r/arainho/git-insecure-workshop
```

### 4. Or push the image manually (optional)
```bash
read -s DOCKER_USERNAME
read -s DOCKER_TOKEN
THE_USER="${DOCKER_USERNAME}" TOKEN="${DOCKER_TOKEN}" make push
```

### 4. Identify your secret
Manually identify Dockerfile with secrets
```bash
bat Dockerfile || cat Dockerfile
```

Use a secret detection tools (e.g. shhgit, trufflehog)
```bash
make secret_detection
```

Analyze the layers of the image uploaded to Docker Hub [[+]](https://hub.docker.com/layers/git-insecure-workshop/arainho/git-insecure-workshop/latest/images/sha256-df67b5c0bbec601c99f89bb024ce12abc035994ad88a9e7df82c534975677cf9?context=repo); can you spot the secret ?


### 5. There is a secret inside the Dockerfile, now what ?
```
- Revoke your secret
- Generate a new one
- Save it in your local password manager (e.g. KeepassXC)
- Or save it on a online password manager (e.g. 1Password)
- Os save it your company secret management solution (e.g. Hashicorp Vault)
```

### 6. Cleanup the compromised Dockerfile
```
- Remove the Dockerfile file from the repository
- The rm and git rm are not enough!... remove it from git history!
- Create a shasum of compromised Dockerfile
- Search and remove files with that hash from CI/CD systems and Buckets
- Remove and block compromised container versions in Container registries ( Cloud and on-prem )
-- Create a new tag for Dockerfile sanitized version 
-- Scan Dockerfile with secret detection and container scanning tools 
```

### 7. Remove image from the container registry
```
- Identify your container registries (DockerHub, AWS ECR, GCP Container registry, other)
- Remove the specific images tags with the secret
- Test all your app images from the registries
```

### 8. Other considerations
```
- Are your registries private or public?
- Is the affected image in use on a running container?
- Check the number of downloads of your image at DockerHub or other registries
- Verify the existence of the container in the Internet Archive, Wayback Machine
```

If the images are in a public registry, then we never know if someone saved the content or not!
So revoking the secrets is crucial in these cases.

### Your done üëç move to step 9
```bash
git checkout step9
```
