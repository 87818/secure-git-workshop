### Proposals
Secrets management program proposal
1. Prevention (Developer can step in)
- gitignore
- pre/post-commit hooks, and provide alternative(s) to hardcoded secrets)

2. Detection (Developers, DevOps, Security can step in)
- pipelines
- repo scanning 

3. Response (most likely Security teams)
- Team to find outliers on a regular cadence)
